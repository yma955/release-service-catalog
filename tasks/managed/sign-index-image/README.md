## Signing data parameters

 The signing configuration should be set as `data.sign` in the _releasePlanAdmission_. Previously it used to be
 set also in the `data.fbc`. The data should be set in the _ReleasePlanAdmission_ as follows:

```
data:
    sign:
        request: <signing pipeline name>
        pipelineImage: <image pullspec>
        configMapName: <configmap name>
```
## Changes in 5.0.1
* Fix typo when reading manifest digests to sign: manifestDigests -> manifest_digests
  * As a result, nothing got signed, because the script always thought there was nothing to sign

## Changes in 4.4.0
* Added compute resource limits

## Changes in 4.3.0
* Add support for multicomponent releases
  * The new mandatory task parameter `fbcResultsPath` points to a file with images and manifest digests to sign
  * Signing is processed in parallel - up to `concurrentLimit` of signing requests at a time

## Changes in 4.2.1
* The default serviceAccount is changed from `appstudio-pipeline` to `release-service-account`

## Changes in 4.2.0
* The pipeline is called via git resolver now instead of cluster resolver
  * This was done by changing from `-r` to `--pipeline` in the `internal-request`/`internal-pipelinerun` call
  * The base image was updated to include this new functionality

## Changes in 4.1.1
* Increase `requestTimeout` value to 30 minutes
  * The internal-request/internal-pipeline is set to a timeout of 30 minutes, but the internal-request/internal-pipeline script
    was set to timeout after 3 minutes, which didn't make much sense.

## Changes in 4.1.0
* Updated task to support the `internal-pipelinerun` requestType
* New mandatory parameter `releasePlanAdmissionPath`
  * It is needed in order to obtain the serviceAccount so it can be used in the PipelineRun definition for the
  internal-pipelinerun

## Changes in 4.0.0
* Added new task parameters `taskGitRevision` and `taskGitUrl`
  * These are passed to the InternalRequest as they are required parameters of the `simple-signing-pipeline`
* The default for `sign.request` is now `simple-signing-pipeline` instead of being `hacbs-signing-pipeline`

## Changes in 3.4.0
* Removed the `request` parameter and references of `fbc.request` from the task and set the default
  internal request pipeline to `hacbs-signing-pipeline`

## Changes in 3.3.0
* Updated the base image used in this task

## Changes in 3.2.0
* Updated the base image used in this task

## Changes in 3.1.0
* Remove `dataPath` default value

## Changes in 3.0.1
* Update task image and make changes to accomodate for new `translate-delivery-repo` funtionality

## Changes in 3.0.0
* This task now requires a list of digests to use in the signing request via the parameter `manifestListDigests`
* The `manifestDigestImage` parameter has been removed.

## Changes in 2.1.0
* Use the translate-delivery-repo util for translating the reference_image variable
  * This change comes with a bump in the image used for the task

## Changes in 2.0.0
* The internalrequest CR is created with a label specifying the pipelinerun uid with the new pipelineRunUid parameter
  * This change comes with a bump in the image used for the task

## Changes in 1.2.1
* add image pullspec rewriting

## Changes in 1.2.0
* Updated hacbs-release/release-utils image to reference redhat-appstudio/release-service-utils image instead

## Changes in 1.1.0
* change the task to use the `internal-request` script

## Changes in 0.1
* update Tekton API to v1
