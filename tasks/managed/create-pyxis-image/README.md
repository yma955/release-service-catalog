# create-pyxis-image

Tekton task that pushes metadata to Pyxis for all container images contained in a snapshot that is the
result of the `apply-mapping` task. It first extracts the containerImages from the snapshot, then runs
`skopeo inspect` on each, before finally pushing metadata to Pyxis.

The task includes protection against race conditions that could occur when multiple components have the same
digest. Components with the same digest are processed in series while different digest groups are processed
in parallel, ensuring optimal performance while preventing conflicts.

The relative path of the pyxis.json file in the data workspace is output as a task result named
`pyxisDataPath`.
